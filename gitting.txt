Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya, the Chief of Army Staff ( COAS) Monday stated that time is up for Bandits, Boko Haram terrorists and others criminals, promising that there will be no hiding place for them.

The Army Chief also issued a stern warning to anyone who take up arms against the Nigerian state in whatever guise to be prepared to face the full wrath of the law.

General Yahaya gave the warning in Maiduguri while on a visit to boost the morale of troops fighting Boko Haram terrorists and commission some projects aimed at bettering the lives and welfare of troops in the Theatre and Area of Responsibility..

According to him, the Army is poised to carry out mandate given to them by President Muhammadu Buhari. He then reassured that violent criminals will soon meet their waterloo.

‘This is a message to all the criminals, whether they are making videos or whatever they are making, the time is up and we will get to them by the grace of God.” Gen. Yahaya said

He added that, ” Anybody who takes up arm against the state in whatever form it is, will have him/her self to blame.”
